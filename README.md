# Black-Scholes-Merton-Class
Formula for the BSM formula with the Greeks. 

In this project, I wrote down the Black-Schole Merton formula with the Greeks using a class (instead of creating a different function each time). There are two rationale for this:

  1. I wanted to practice the usage of CLASS (instead of defining multiple function)
  2. I thought it would be useful to have the code written somewhere in case I need it in the future.
